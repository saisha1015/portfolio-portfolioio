This is a collection of all of the work I did at Jones College Prep.

Project 1: Conditionals Project
Summary:  We made solutions to different types of problems a function. 
Key Details:
Wrote a function with an age parameter that checks to see if a person is eligible to vote (>18) 
Wrote a function with 3 integer parameters (a,b,c) that prints the largest of the three numbers 
Wrote a function with a score parameter that prints the equivalent letter grade of that score

Project 2: Madlibs Project
Summary: We created a fun and interactive game that allows users to input words and generate a nonsensical story.
Key Details: 
The code introduce users to the game of MadLib with print() statements
Asks the user to enter words for the blanks in the story.
Creates a story with the user's input using string concatenation
Prinst the completed story to the console using the print() function. 

Project 3: Multiplication Quiz Project
Summary: We created a program that quizzes the user on multiplication problems. After the quiz, display the user's score.
Key Details: 
Welcomed the user to the game
Used the random library to generate a random multiplication problem and allowed the user to answer it.
Checked to see if the user's answer is correct and updated the score accordingly
Used a loop to repeat the process 5 times
Gave the user their final score

Project 4: Rock Paper Scissors Project
Summary: The player plays the game of "Rock-Paper-Scissors" against the computer. The game involves selecting either rock, paper, or scissors and comparing the choices to determine the winner. The program keeps track of the score and give the player the option to play again.
Key Details:
Creates a Python program that implements the "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game.
Asks the player to input their move choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
Uses a random number generator to have the computer choose its move (rock, paper, or scissors).
Compares the player's choice and the computer's choice to decide the winner based on the known rules.

Project 5: Simple Calculator Project
Summary: We created a simple calculator program that allows the user to perform basic mathematical operations.
Key Details:
The program displays a menu of options for the user to choose from: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Quit the program
The program defines five functions, one for each mathematical operation, that takes two parameters, and returns the result of the operation
The program makes the user to enter two numbers and the operation to perform.
The program calls the appropriate function based on the user's input and display the result.
The program continues to display the menu of options and allow the user to perform multiple calculations until the user chooses to quit the program.
